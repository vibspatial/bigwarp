    "This notebook describes how you can transform geometries from GeoJSON files using `BigWarp` in `FIJI`. This is useful, for example, when you annotate regions on an image (e.g. in `QuPath`) that is not aligned to the same coordinate space as the other images in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Steps</b>:\n",
    "1. <b>Place landmarks in BigWarp</b>\n",
    "    - Load your moving and fixed images into `BigWarp`, place corresponding landmarks until they are nicely coregistered, and export the landmarks.csv (see detailed explanation in README.md). One of your images should be in the same coordinate space as the geometries in your GeoJSON file (preferably the moving image, but this can be reversed later if needed). The other image should be in the coordinate space you wish to transform the geometries into (the fixed image).\n",
    "    - Optionally, export the warped moving image at this time as well (see README.md).\n",
    "2. <b>Convert the GeoJSON geometries into a series of coordinates</b>\n",
    "    - Use the `convert_geometries_for_bigwarp` function to convert your GeoJSON file into a CSV. This converts each geometry into a list of coordinate points that can be transformed by BigWarp and the metadata required to reconstruct the geometry later on. See the docstring of this function for more information.\n",
    "3. <b>Transform the exported coordinates according to the BigWarp transformation</b>\n",
    "    - Open the `warp_points_bigwarp.groovy` script from this repository in FIJI.\n",
    "    - Select the landmarks.csv file produced by BigWarp.\n",
    "    - Select the coordinates CSV created in step 2.\n",
    "    - Pick a path to save the output CSV.\n",
    "    - Specify which columns correspond to the X and Y coordinates (usually `x` and `y`).\n",
    "    - Choose names for the output columns (e.g. `x_warped`, `y_warped`).\n",
    "    - Pick the transformation model (e.g. Thin Plate Spline, Affine, ...).\n",
    "    - Apply scaling to the moving and/or fixed landmark coordinates if needed. Depending on how you use BigWarp, the landmark coordinates can be in pixels, micrometers, millimeters, ..., while the coordinates in your GeoJSON geometries are usually in pixels.\n",
    "    - Optionally, swap the moving and fixed landmarks. If unchecked, the script will transform from moving image to fixed image. If checked, the transformation direction will be reversed.\n",
    "4. <b>Reconstruct GeoJSON geometries using the warped coordinates</b>\n",
    "    - Use `create_warped_geometries` to rebuild each geometry using the warped coordinates from step 3 and create a new GeoJSON containing the warped geometries. See the docstring of this function for more information."
